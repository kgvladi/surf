Fortran programs for compact representation of highly complex quantum dynamics on multiple electronic states.  
<br/>The relaxation of a dynamical system is usually described in terms of how its density changes. From the density one can obtain the rate of change of observables. Here we explore an information theory view. We ask how does the surprisal and thereby the entropy evolve, looking specifically at their variance in time. A compact representation of the surprisal is in terms of its expansion as a series of dominant, time independent, observables with time dependent coefficients. The ‘dominant’ observables are those whose given expectation value changes most the computed information theory entropy of the system. The time-dependence of the surprisal, and so the density, is fully carried by the coefficients of the observables, their Lagrange multipliers. These coefficients are determined as eigenvectors of the surprisal time-covariance matrix.
